My name is Adel Zaalouk, a free-style researcher who cares more about knowledge than titles and I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer (with a soft-side for product management) focusing on all things Kubernetes (checkout the [Gardener Project](https://github.com/gardener)).

Throughout my career I wore different hats, in different countries working with different people from a broad spectrum of nationalities. Initially, I started in research with a strong focus on Software-Defined Networking (back in the buzz days), and moved slowly to the industry side, covering / advocating for software-defined concepts across the entire stack.

Nowadays, I work mostly with Kubernetes and containers, paving my way through the cloud-native stack with a researchy attitude. I love tinkering around with new tech, and sharing my learnings. I share my learnings either in the form of blog-posts, publications, talks, or in meet-ups where I get to meet and learn from awesome minded people in the community.

I also like to organize meetups, so I started quite a few. Truth to be told, some are not active anymore but dear to my heart to shut-down (maybe there is a future to them?).


Below you can find some references and pointers to some of my work.
