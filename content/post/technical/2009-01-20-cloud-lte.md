I have been thinking for a while, what would it be like in 3 or 4 years ahead, and I started noticing that everybody is starting to love the “Cloud”, I won’t lie, I love it to :D, It is exponentially increasing, some of the ISP’s have already started using the cloud, it is a pretty neat concept, for some of you who are not familiar with the cloud: Imagine that you are subscribing to a bank and you are no longer keeping your money under you bed :D, well everybody doesn’t now, no body is hiding his money under his bed. Cloud computing simply follows the same concept, If you are worried about the future when your company starts to grow bigger and bigger and so do your network equipments, data centers, IT staff, and the fact that you won’t be able to scale anymore or to manage it efficiently, well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore, that cloud takes a good care of your “Money” (The bank analogy ).

It’s is becoming obvious that after about 2 years most of the ISP’s and the companies will start using the cloud, now if you think about it, LTE is a fast growing technology as well that is IP based, this means that it will be using the cloud to, now I am starting to think like, OMG :D, it’s gonna be amazing, I am already starting to feel it = ), with LTE on board, the telecommunication industry will evolve and the whole world will be connected in a glance = ).
