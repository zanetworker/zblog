Okayy, So I spent some time trying to get ubuntu to play out .wmv files, it took me a little while to figure that out. Here is how:

- First you need to download an adequate player. I Personally use “mplayer”

You can use synaptic manager and search for it.
Or, you could download it using this command

```bash
sudo apt-get install mplayer
```

- Now, Let’s install some packages from medibuntu. For those who don’t know what medibuntu is:

“Medibuntu (Multimedia, Entertainment & Distractions In Ubuntu) is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons (copyright, license, patent, etc).”

To download this packages, we use:  

```bash
sudo wget –output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get –quiet update && sudo apt-get –yes –quiet –allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get –quiet update
```

Quite a large command xD.

- You could also download these additional codecs ” sudo apt-get install w32codes libdvdcss2″ and if your system is 64 bits, replace 32 with 64

- Now for our final blow, type these two commands:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
```

I hope this helps =).

Have a good day!!
