We tend to have a very narrow perspective when it comes to defining happiness. Some people think that happiness is where "happy" people are. Truth is, it has noting to do with the location, I am not sure how to describe it, there are many factors that when combined can make you happy, I am not sure I ever experienced fully fledged happiness, but I experience inner-peace every once in a while and I believe that inner peace is one of the magic ingredients of happiness.

There are many definitions out there for happiness, I will list a few that I think are true.

1. "Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for." ~ Joseph Addison
2. "Independence is happiness" ~ Susan B. Anthony
3. "Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude." ~ Denis Waitley
4. "Happiness... consists in giving, and in serving others."~ John Barrymore


And there are many more, fact is, it depends on whom you ask. We are all different, we have different genes, different personalities, different backgrounds, etc. But what I strongly believe is that happiness has nothing to do with external materialistic factors like location, it is a state of mind, it is solely governed by who we truly are.

So here is my conclusion, don't stress yourself onto thinking that happiness has anything to do with the location, instead, focus on the "now", on the blessings you have and find inner-peace, break those materialistic chains and start enjoying what you have with those you love (before it is too late, although it never really is)

"Happiness is not a destination, its a Journey"

Have great day!
