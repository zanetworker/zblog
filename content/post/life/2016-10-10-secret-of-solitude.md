Have you ever tried to spend sometime alone somewhere, thinking about nothing, just letting your absolute self talk to you. I have, and it feels great.

Usually, we are occupied mentally by tasks that we are mandated to finish, meetings that we have to attend, people that we have to discuss with, thus leaving no time for ourselves, for discussing important life matters, for defining who we truly are in this life. We get exhausted by the negativity of others, and we lose the sense of gratitude, as a result we are driven to think that we are hollows (i.e., shallow beings with no value)

The answer to all this is “solitude”, giving our minds a chance to create! We give our brains no time, we let the noise of a busy life rub away our own valuable thoughts, and this is unfair.

I am just sharing my thoughts here :)

Have a nice day you!
