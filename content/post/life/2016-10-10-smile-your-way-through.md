I am walking across the office corridor right after the weekend, I push my mouth wide open to both of its ends, nod my head and give a friendly smile, what do I get in return? Nothing!

Some people do not understand the value of a simple friendly smile, or the effect of it on someone else. I think of it as a sign of respect and appreciation in the work place, a gesture of kindness. And Hey! I am not telling you to flirt with your colleagues for god’s sake, I am just saying be friendly. If you dont want to smile, just nod your head, dont just ignore that person when your eyes cross.

Smile, it helps sometimes :)
