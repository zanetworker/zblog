      <description>Recently I have been trying to wrap my head around what has been happening in the kubernetes runtime space, doing so made me realize that alot has happened and I was too busy to catch up, as a result, I decided to write this blog post which summarizes my thoughts after reading up a bit.
Have a look at this post&amp;rsquo;s outline and feel free to jump to sections of choice if you already feel confident about the topic.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has been taking over the container orchesteration stage for sometime now, it has a large community and a great set of tooling and contributers backing it. Along those lines, picking up kubernetes skills can be a little daunting at first, but fear not, as documentation is rich and concepts are well elaborated in not one but many places.
In this post, I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to re-explain kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services, replicasets, &amp;hellip;etc) since as I said, a lot of great people did that job already, and did it very well (if you still have doubts about some of the concepts, I would be glad to help clear smoke up).</description>

      <description>Okay, so I am going to try and make this brief and to the point for you to get going. You need a Kubernetes cluster working with Kubeadm? good you are in the right place.
First, lets get over the problems first. What you need to see at the end is the following:
kube-system dummy-2088944543-1x359 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system etcd-master 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-apiserver-master 1/1 Running 0 1d kube-system kube-controller-manager-master 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-discovery-1769846148-1khb9 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-dns-2924299975-pg660 4/4 Running 4 1d kube-system kube-flannel-ds-25l4t 2/2 Running 2 1d kube-system kube-flannel-ds-9jtd5 2/2 Running 2 1d kube-system kube-flannel-ds-lvskl 2/2 Running 8 1d kube-system kube-proxy-l1hn5 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-proxy-p1kbt 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-proxy-x2b1m 1/1 Running 1 1d kube-system kube-scheduler-master 1/1 Running 1 1d Not this &amp;hellip;</description>
