      <description>IT Manager, Ops, and network administrators suffer today from the complex approaches being followed towards network operations which gives no space for innovation. Additionally, the current box-by-box approaches for configuration and provision can be cumbersome and lack agility to turn up new services quickly to meet demands and Service-Level Agreements (SLA) of internal customers. Adopting a new approach towards network automation is key to addressing these challenges, by automating network operation not only do we reduce operational and management expenses but we also provide investment protection as we adopt the application economy (a software approach that grows much faster).</description>

      <description>Okay, the difference between a layer 3 router, switch and a multilayer switch seems to confuse alot of networkers, so I decided to write this to briefly explain in a nutshell the main between both.
Before starting to talk about layer 3 switches or multi-layer switches, why not briefly summarize &amp;ldquo;Switching&amp;rdquo; as in basic layer 2 switching.Before switches existed there were devices called bridges, and I will not be explaining or going into much details about what is a bridge, but here is the main differences between a bridge and a switch:</description>

      <description>As a network engineer you must have skimmed through millions of acronyms and abbreviations like MAC, IP, FTP, &amp;hellip;.. and so on, they are un-countable :D. Sometimes these abbreviations mix them into a cocktail in my head, so Today I thought of re-visiting some of these abbreviations and concepts that I consider fairly important if you are considering to understand switching. So let&amp;rsquo;s start of by defining each one of these abbreviations.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;IP telephony is the Concept, VoIP is the Use&amp;rdquo;
I believe this quote can serves as an answer to the Big Question, but what does this really mean ?. To answer this question lets define each term separately.
IP telephony: It is a term used to describe the area of communication that is based on Internet standards like the Internet Protocol (IP). Examples of an IP telephony system include and IP Public Private Exchange (PBX).</description>

      <description>Here are the brief steps of how to recover passwords on Your Cisco Router:
 Type show version to check on the current value of the configuration register. The configuration register is usually set set to 0x2102 or 0x102. Turn the router off and turn it back on. Within the first 60 seconds, press Ctrl+Break to exit the Boot sequence and enter the Rommon mode. In the rommon mode type confreg 0x2142.</description>

      <description>Long time I had this question in my head, why do we subnet, yea I am being a smart guy, I am very good at sub-netting but I didn’t know why it is so crucial.
Well there are many answers to that question, the most general ones are:
 Reduced network traffic Optimized network performance Simplified management Facilitated spanning of large geographical distances.  Okay, that’s cool but still, How does it do these “bla bla written above” =D ?</description>

      <description>Some people are windows oriented, others are linux oriented.

Here is how to download, Setup and Install minicom on ubuntu to be ready for use.
 First you have to download and install minicom:  sudo apt-get install minicom Okay cool, now that you have installed it, you might want to find out the name of your serial port, Here is how:</description>
