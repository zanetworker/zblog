      <title>Docktorino: Building Containers with Confidence</title>

      <description>Docktorino is a real-time continious testing tool for your docker builds, helping you containerize with confidence!
When building Docker images it is sometimes tricky to assert the image behavior, for example, whether the contents of the image you built is correct, or that commands can execute correctly inside your container ( maybe you forgot to set your binary&amp;rsquo;s PATH).
Docktrino makes these types of assertions easy to define when building your Docker images.</description>

      <title>DOCKument: Auto-generating Documentation for Dockerfiles and Images</title>

      <description>DOCKument is a tool that helps you auto-generate documentation for your Dockerfiles and Docker images the way you would an API.
Matthias LÃ¼bken gave an example on how to use &amp;ldquo;API&amp;rdquo; like labels to describe important information in the Dockerfile (e.g., resources used, exposed ports, dependencies, etc) here. This project makes use of similar label patterns to fetch important data in Dockerfiles / Docker images and create Dockumentation for it automagically.</description>

      <title>eBPF, Microservices, Docker, and Cilium: From Novice to Seasoned </title>

      <description>In this post we will be covering eBPF concepts, as well as challenges faced when applying network policies for microservices and how these challenges can be tackled. Finally, we will have a look at Cilium to see how it makes eBPF simple and easy to utilize.
 Introduction - What is eBPF - The bpf() system call - Important use-cases for eBPF - How to create an eBPF program? Microservices - What are Microservices and how do they work?</description>

      <title>Demystifying Moby: From OCI to Linuxkit</title>
      <link>https://adelzaalouk.me/post/technical/2017-05-03-moby-linuxkit/</link>

      <description>OCI, Containerd, runC, Moby, linuxkit are all relatively new components that work together for building containers. In this post we will explain each component and how these components relate to one another.
 Lets Start with the Basics (OCI, runC, Containerd)  So what is the Open Container Initiative (OCI)?   What are runC and Containerd? Demistyfing Moby &amp;amp; The LinuxKit Linuxkit Test-Drive Important References  Lets Start with the Basics (OCI, runC, Containerd) Before jumping in and talking about Moby and Linuxkit, it is important to establish some basic knowledge first, this will make understanding Linuxkit much easier.</description>

      <description>As you might know already Docker is now the defacto standard for containers. It is being used as the run-time for many clustering frameworks. Therefore, I thought about summarizing some of the important commands that you might need in your day-to-day docker life.
I hope this post will be useful for you.
General Docker Commands ## Tagging an image docker tage &amp;lt;image_id&amp;gt; name_of_the_image #real time logs docker logs --tail 1 --follow cbceaaea0ef5 # Forcing a rebuild docker build --no-cache # publish a port even if it was not expose in the dockerfile docker run -p &amp;lt;port&amp;gt; # publish all ports that were explosed in the docker file docker run -P # Setting up environment variables docker run -e WEBAPP_PORT=8000 -e WEBAPP_HOST=www.</description>
