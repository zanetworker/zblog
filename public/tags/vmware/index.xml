      <description>I have recently had the chance to do some reading on VMware NSX. I come from a networking background Intertwined with software, previously I have had a chance to research on some of the underpinnings of NSX but never had the time to look at the big picture, so in this writing, I am going to briefly describe the NSX architecture.
What is NSX? Management Plane Control Plane Data Plane In summary, I found NSX pretty decent compared to other Software-Defined solutions out there.</description>
