      <description>I have received many questions about a new project that I have created called GoSayan, so I decided to write a blog post about it.
What is GoSayan? Needless to say that GoSayan is a project I started to work on as a hobby in my free time.
So I am a &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; kind of person, even when I was learning Golang, I tried coding as many stub projects as I could, however, there is a limit to the amount of knowledge I can acquire because I have another life to live :D.</description>

      <description>Welcome to &amp;ldquo;Go Recipes For the Lost&amp;rdquo; post, this is a live post, it won&amp;rsquo;t ever be done as long as I am writing go code. The intention here is to share with you some fast resolution for common Go coding problems. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Undefined function even though it is declared in another file! When you would like to use functions defined in another go file, and you are using the &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; command.</description>
