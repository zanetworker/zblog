      <description>We tend to have a very narrow perspective when it comes to defining happiness. Some people think that happiness is where &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; people are. Truth is, it has noting to do with the location, I am not sure how to describe it, there are many factors that when combined can make you happy, I am not sure I ever experienced fully fledged happiness, but I experience inner-peace every once in a while and I believe that inner peace is one of the magic ingredients of happiness.</description>
