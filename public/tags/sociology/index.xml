      <description>I am walking across the office corridor right after the weekend, I push my mouth wide open to both of its ends, nod my head and give a friendly smile, what do I get in return? Nothing!
Some people do not understand the value of a simple friendly smile, or the effect of it on someone else. I think of it as a sign of respect and appreciation in the work place, a gesture of kindness.</description>
