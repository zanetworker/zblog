      <description>Recently I have been trying to wrap my head around what has been happening in the kubernetes runtime space, doing so made me realize that alot has happened and I was too busy to catch up, as a result, I decided to write this blog post which summarizes my thoughts after reading up a bit.
Have a look at this post&amp;rsquo;s outline and feel free to jump to sections of choice if you already feel confident about the topic.</description>
