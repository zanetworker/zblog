						<div class="post-summary"><p>I have received many questions about a new project that I have created called GoSayan, so I decided to write a blog post about it.
What is GoSayan? Needless to say that GoSayan is a project I started to work on as a hobby in my free time.
So I am a &ldquo;learn by doing&rdquo; kind of person, even when I was learning Golang, I tried coding as many stub projects as I could, however, there is a limit to the amount of knowledge I can acquire because I have another life to live :D.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Microservices are decoupled components that follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), that is, a component does one thing but does it really well. In this mini-book we will be discussing various patterns for decomposing a service into a microservice.
 What motivates developers to go Micro? How to decompose your services? Handling Cross-cutting concerns Handling communication between micro-services ? Service-Discovery - Where is my-service? Handling failure across dependent services (Circuit breaking reliability) Handling storage-dependencies for microservices Handling access to services Service Function Validation Logging, Instrumentation, and health-checking (Observability) Is it really worth it?</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>In this post we will walk through the definitions, Properties and patterns for building Microservices.
What are Microservices? A microservice is really just a service that adheres to a slightly looser definition of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) that arose from patterns for object-oriented design. It is a service that does one thing.
Properties of Microservices  Small, and Focused on Doing One Thing Well AutonomusTo do decoupling well, youâ€™ll need to model your services right and get the APIs right.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>In today&rsquo;s virtual network architecture, NFV is paving the way to become to defacto standard for providing network services in the cloud. NFV relies on Service Function Chaining (SFC), to stitch services together to provide a service-path for packets to traverse.
OpenStack, one of the more successful open cloud platforms is considered a good base to start building services for NFV related functions. In this post, we will be having a sneak-peak over the components exposed by neutron-sfc, the service chaining API exposed by OpenStack.</p></div>
