      <title>Docktorino: Building Containers with Confidence</title>

      <description>Docktorino is a real-time continious testing tool for your docker builds, helping you containerize with confidence!
When building Docker images it is sometimes tricky to assert the image behavior, for example, whether the contents of the image you built is correct, or that commands can execute correctly inside your container ( maybe you forgot to set your binary&amp;rsquo;s PATH).
Docktrino makes these types of assertions easy to define when building your Docker images.</description>

      <description>DOCKument is a tool that helps you auto-generate documentation for your Dockerfiles and Docker images the way you would an API.
Matthias LÃ¼bken gave an example on how to use &amp;ldquo;API&amp;rdquo; like labels to describe important information in the Dockerfile (e.g., resources used, exposed ports, dependencies, etc) here. This project makes use of similar label patterns to fetch important data in Dockerfiles / Docker images and create Dockumentation for it automagically.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has been taking over the container orchesteration stage for sometime now, it has a large community and a great set of tooling and contributers backing it. Along those lines, picking up kubernetes skills can be a little daunting at first, but fear not, as documentation is rich and concepts are well elaborated in not one but many places.
In this post, I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to re-explain kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services, replicasets, &amp;hellip;etc) since as I said, a lot of great people did that job already, and did it very well (if you still have doubts about some of the concepts, I would be glad to help clear smoke up).</description>

      <description>I am walking across the office corridor right after the weekend, I push my mouth wide open to both of its ends, nod my head and give a friendly smile, what do I get in return? Nothing!
Some people do not understand the value of a simple friendly smile, or the effect of it on someone else. I think of it as a sign of respect and appreciation in the work place, a gesture of kindness.</description>

      <description>Alright, so recently I decided to use sensor for different applications. Sensors are a great way to hear, see, and even feel things that we as humans can&amp;rsquo;t see or hear. This post is the first in a long series to come about making, circuits, and the discovery of the world of things around use.
 Components How does an ultrasonic sensor work?  My latest project was to use an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance.</description>

      <description>OCI, Containerd, runC, Moby, linuxkit are all relatively new components that work together for building containers. In this post we will explain each component and how these components relate to one another.
 Lets Start with the Basics (OCI, runC, Containerd)  So what is the Open Container Initiative (OCI)?   What are runC and Containerd? Demistyfing Moby &amp;amp; The LinuxKit Linuxkit Test-Drive Important References  Lets Start with the Basics (OCI, runC, Containerd) Before jumping in and talking about Moby and Linuxkit, it is important to establish some basic knowledge first, this will make understanding Linuxkit much easier.</description>

      <description>As you might know already Docker is now the defacto standard for containers. It is being used as the run-time for many clustering frameworks. Therefore, I thought about summarizing some of the important commands that you might need in your day-to-day docker life.
I hope this post will be useful for you.
General Docker Commands ## Tagging an image docker tage &amp;lt;image_id&amp;gt; name_of_the_image #real time logs docker logs --tail 1 --follow cbceaaea0ef5 # Forcing a rebuild docker build --no-cache # publish a port even if it was not expose in the dockerfile docker run -p &amp;lt;port&amp;gt; # publish all ports that were explosed in the docker file docker run -P # Setting up environment variables docker run -e WEBAPP_PORT=8000 -e WEBAPP_HOST=www.</description>

      <description>I have received many questions about a new project that I have created called GoSayan, so I decided to write a blog post about it.
What is GoSayan? Needless to say that GoSayan is a project I started to work on as a hobby in my free time.
So I am a &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; kind of person, even when I was learning Golang, I tried coding as many stub projects as I could, however, there is a limit to the amount of knowledge I can acquire because I have another life to live :D.</description>

      <description>Microservices are decoupled components that follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), that is, a component does one thing but does it really well. In this mini-book we will be discussing various patterns for decomposing a service into a microservice.
 What motivates developers to go Micro? How to decompose your services? Handling Cross-cutting concerns Handling communication between micro-services ? Service-Discovery - Where is my-service? Handling failure across dependent services (Circuit breaking reliability) Handling storage-dependencies for microservices Handling access to services Service Function Validation Logging, Instrumentation, and health-checking (Observability) Is it really worth it?</description>

      <description>In this post we will walk through the definitions, Properties and patterns for building Microservices.
What are Microservices? A microservice is really just a service that adheres to a slightly looser definition of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) that arose from patterns for object-oriented design. It is a service that does one thing.
Properties of Microservices  Small, and Focused on Doing One Thing Well AutonomusTo do decoupling well, youâll need to model your services right and get the APIs right.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to spend sometime alone somewhere, thinking about nothing, just letting your absolute self talk to you. I have, and it feels great.
Usually, we are occupied mentally by tasks that we are mandated to finish, meetings that we have to attend, people that we have to discuss with, thus leaving no time for ourselves, for discussing important life matters, for defining who we truly are in this life.</description>

      <description>As a young kid, I strived for being good at school, for being the best at the swimming club, for getting high honors, and most importantly for being recognized and acknowledged by my peers at school and my family at home. My purpose was to please others and not myself, and as I grew up and started to get a grip at how the world works, I started to feel empty inside, I started to feel that I have not done anything for myself but I have done it all for others.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s virtual network architecture, NFV is paving the way to become to defacto standard for providing network services in the cloud. NFV relies on Service Function Chaining (SFC), to stitch services together to provide a service-path for packets to traverse.
OpenStack, one of the more successful open cloud platforms is considered a good base to start building services for NFV related functions. In this post, we will be having a sneak-peak over the components exposed by neutron-sfc, the service chaining API exposed by OpenStack.</description>

      <description>We tend to have a very narrow perspective when it comes to defining happiness. Some people think that happiness is where &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; people are. Truth is, it has noting to do with the location, I am not sure how to describe it, there are many factors that when combined can make you happy, I am not sure I ever experienced fully fledged happiness, but I experience inner-peace every once in a while and I believe that inner peace is one of the magic ingredients of happiness.</description>

Before I start to talk about OpenStack specifically, let me explain why this series is called the âSoftware-Definedâ series. The term Software-Defined was first used to describe networks which follow these following patterns:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The formal definition for CloudArray is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âEMC-Cloud Array is a data storage software technology that easily integrates cloud (object) storage into traditional enterprise IT environmentsâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if the definition really reflects what CloudArray does, CloudArray can be considered as a Cloud-Gateway, the reason I think of it this way is because it acts as a middle-man between Applications that talk standard SAN/NAS protocols (iSCSI, NFS, CIFS, and SMB) and public or private cloud providers (e.g., Amazon EC2, OpenStack, ECS, Atmos, Google Cloud, etc.) where most of them are Object-storage based.Â  CloudArray presents Object storage as local-disks to your hosts and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>IT Manager, Ops, and network administrators suffer today from the complex approaches being followed towards network operations which gives no space for innovation. Additionally, the current box-by-box approaches for configuration and provision can be cumbersome and lack agility to turn up new services quickly to meet demands and Service-Level Agreements (SLA) of internal customers. Adopting a new approach towards network automation is key to addressing these challenges, by automating network operation not only do we reduce operational and management expenses but we also provide investment protection as we adopt the application economy (a software approach that grows much faster).</description>

      <description>Current networking architectures are quite different from the Original Internet as we know it, they are hungry for services and applications that canât be supported by normal Internet devices and technologies. For example, the explosion of mobile devices and content, server virtualisation and the advent of cloud services are one of the main change driven technologies for a new Internet that is able to support these various kinds of technologies without having to increase the complexity of the network.</description>

      <description>Well,
I have been through multiple forums looking for the best way that works for me to play a streamed video file from a server or from my local machine, and I found an easy way to do that, here is how:
public void onCreate(Bundle icicle) { super.onCreate(icicle); getWindow().setFormat(PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; yourVideoView = new VideoView(this); yourVideoView.setMediaController(new MediaController(this)); setContentView(yourVideoView); // This works fine for almost all MPEG-4 and H.264 containers you find out there  // If you have the video file on your sdk card  yourVideoView.</description>

      <description>Okay, I have to admit I wasnât a big fan of functional programming languages, but looking at the benefits that it introduces, it might not be a very bad idea to put it under the microscope for a while.
So, in this blog post I am going to list some of the benefits that are introduced by functional programming language.
  âPolymorphic Type Systemsâ : Functional programing languages usually lets you use functions for many types (belonging to the same class), thus making use of the concepts of generecity and tragically reducing the software maintenance costs.</description>

      <description>I have been away for a while now but every time I think I wonât need to lay a hand on C++ or any object oriented programming language I find my self mandated to do so. So I thought It would be helpful for people like me to look at this post if they got lost and forgot some of the basic concepts.
In this post, I will talk specifically about the difference between public, private and protected key words.</description>

      <description>Okay, the difference between a layer 3 router, switch and a multilayer switch seems to confuse alot of networkers, so I decided to write this to briefly explain in a nutshell the main between both.
Before starting to talk about layer 3 switches or multi-layer switches, why not briefly summarize &amp;ldquo;Switching&amp;rdquo; as in basic layer 2 switching.Before switches existed there were devices called bridges, and I will not be explaining or going into much details about what is a bridge, but here is the main differences between a bridge and a switch:</description>

      <description>As a network engineer you must have skimmed through millions of acronyms and abbreviations like MAC, IP, FTP, &amp;hellip;.. and so on, they are un-countable :D. Sometimes these abbreviations mix them into a cocktail in my head, so Today I thought of re-visiting some of these abbreviations and concepts that I consider fairly important if you are considering to understand switching. So let&amp;rsquo;s start of by defining each one of these abbreviations.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;IP telephony is the Concept, VoIP is the Use&amp;rdquo;
I believe this quote can serves as an answer to the Big Question, but what does this really mean ?. To answer this question lets define each term separately.
IP telephony: It is a term used to describe the area of communication that is based on Internet standards like the Internet Protocol (IP). Examples of an IP telephony system include and IP Public Private Exchange (PBX).</description>

 First you need to download an adequate player. I Personally use âmplayerâ  You can use synaptic manager and search for it. Or, you could download it using this command
sudo apt-get install mplayer  Now, Letâs install some packages from medibuntu.</description>

      <description>Long time I had this question in my head, why do we subnet, yea I am being a smart guy, I am very good at sub-netting but I didnât know why it is so crucial.
Well there are many answers to that question, the most general ones are:
 Reduced network traffic Optimized network performance Simplified management Facilitated spanning of large geographical distances.  Okay, thatâs cool but still, How does it do these âbla bla written aboveâ =D ?</description>

 First you have to download and install minicom:  sudo apt-get install minicom Okay cool, now that you have installed it, you might want to find out the name of your serial port, Here is how:</description>

      <description>I spent some time trying to find out how to put other views in the same place with a ListActivity and I figured out 2 different ways :
First,Â you can create a new XML file that should contain a listViewlike this for example:
android:orientation=&amp;#34;vertical&amp;#34; android:layout_width=&amp;#34;fill_parent&amp;#34; android:layout_height=&amp;#34;fill_parent&amp;#34; android:background=&amp;#34;@color/black&amp;#34;&amp;gt; android:layout_width=&amp;#34;wrap_content&amp;#34; android:layout_height=&amp;#34;wrap_content&amp;#34; android:src=&amp;#34;@drawable/home&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; android:layout_width=&amp;#34;fill_parent&amp;#34; android:layout_height=&amp;#34;fill_parent&amp;#34; android:drawSelectorOnTop=&amp;#34;false&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; Then, in your activity type the following
setContentView(&amp;#34;xmlFile&amp;#34;); Here for example, I would likeÂ to put that image within my ListActivity.</description>

      <description>I was stuck for like three hours trying to figure out how to change the background of a ListActivity because I have used an adapter with a layout for each item so when I change the background at the layout, only the item&amp;rsquo;s background is changed, but at the end I figured that it was very easy here is how I did it :-
inside your onCreate() preferably before setting any adapters or putting any views, you insert the following line : getListView().</description>

      <description>In advanced mobile applications or normal ones , a developer should communicate with the user using some feed backs so changing the color of an image or label when clicked gives the user the feedback that he has really clicked something, here how it is done. In your onClick() method , use the following method :
setColorFilter(&amp;#34;color in hexa&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34;) In my case I use
button.setColorFilter(0x77000000,Mode.SRC_ATOP); doing this you will change the Colour but if you pressed the back button , you will find it stuck on the colour you changed ,to return things as they were you can either use</description>

      <guid>/post/technical/2008-10-20-how-to-be-a-networker/</guid>
      <description>Well, Lets say that most of the People have wrong concept of Who is A network Engineer and whose not,in Order to Clarify this Vague concept among people and also to answer the question that almost Most students or young Engineers ask them selves âHow to be a Networker ?â, I will First Define who is A newtork Engineer.
A Network Engineer is A Guy who takes the best of both worlds (Communications and Computer Science) and merge them into one to get into the âCommunter Science â world ð ,so A Network Engineer is like a federal spy, he can get into a room full of aliens and never be exposed, also most people think that some Certifications will make you a network Engineer that easily, well I admit that certifications give you quite a good understanding of IT stuff but not Engineering stuff, anyway lets get to the second Question already.</description>
